The R package `bkmr` implements Bayesian kernel machine regression, a statistical approach for estimating the joint health effects of multiple concurrent exposures. Additional information on the statistical methodology and on the computational details are provided in [Bobb et al. 2015](http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/3/493). More recent extensions, details on the software, and worked-through examples are provided in [Bobb et al. 2018](https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-018-0413-y).

You can install the latest releasted version of `bkmr` from CRAN with:
```R
install.packages("bkmr")
```
Or the latest development version from github with:
```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jenfb/bkmr")
```
